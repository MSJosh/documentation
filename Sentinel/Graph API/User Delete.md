#### Description
When it comes to impact, Microsoft Graph API includes multiple functions that can be misused to allow unauthorized access to sensitive data and resources. This could lead to account access removals, data destruction, and/or resource hijacking. Such activities can significantly disrupt business operations, result in financial losses, and damage an organizationâ€™s reputation.


#### Risk
In this scenario, the bad actor abuses an application with the "User.ReadWrite.All" role to delete a user, disrupting business operations.
